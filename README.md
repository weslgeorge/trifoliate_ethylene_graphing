# trifoliate_ethylene_graphing
A short and simplified method to my graphing of ethylene data generated by measuring ethylene production in mutagenized cowpea in the Steinbrenner Lab.

More summary information can be found in the figure_pipeline_markdown.Rmd! In breif this is just an example of the plotting I use for the ethylene data I generated in the Steinbrenner lab
